12)Tell me about the Constructors in java why we create the constructor in class

In Java, a constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects. It is called when an instance of a class is created. Here's a detailed explanation:

What is a Constructor?
----------------------
A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that gets executed when an object is created. Unlike methods, constructors:

Have the same name as the class: This is a key feature. If your class is named Car, the constructor must also be named Car.
Do not have a return type: Constructors do not return a value, not even void.
Are automatically called when an object is instantiated: You donâ€™t need to manually call the constructor; it is invoked implicitly when you create an object of the class.

Why Do We Create Constructors?

Object Initialization:
----------------------
The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the newly created object. It allows you to set the initial state of an object, like assigning values to the fields of the object.

Overloading Constructors:
-------------------------
You can overload constructors, which means you can create multiple constructors in a class, each with different parameters. This allows you to initialize objects in different ways depending on what data is available when the object is created.

Enforcing Object Creation Rules:
--------------------------------
By providing specific constructors, you can enforce certain rules about how an object can be created. For example, you can make sure that certain fields are always initialized to a valid value.
