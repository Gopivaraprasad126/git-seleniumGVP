13what is the exceptios of Alerts: 
===============================

In Selenium, if you try to interact with an alert but can't find the dismiss button or encounter an issue with handling the alert, you might encounter the following exceptions:

NoAlertPresentException:
------------------------
This occurs if you try to interact with an alert (like accepting or dismissing it) when no alert is present on the page.

UnhandledAlertException:
------------------------
This happens when an unexpected alert is present, and Selenium is unable to handle it. If you try to interact with elements on the page without first dismissing or accepting the alert, you'll likely encounter this exception.

ElementNotInteractableException:
-------------------------------- 
This can occur if the dismiss button is present but not interactable, perhaps due to being hidden, disabled, or covered by another element.

NoSuchElementException: 
-----------------------
Although this is more common when trying to find a regular DOM element, if you're trying to locate a dismiss button in the DOM (not as part of the alert API) and it doesn't exist, you might encounter this exception.

To handle alerts in Selenium, you typically don't locate buttons directly in the DOM. Instead, use the Alert interface:

Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
alert.accept();  // To accept the alert
alert.dismiss();  // To dismiss the alert
This should help avoid issues with finding the dismiss button directly in the DOM.
