9)Is the 100% Abstraction is possible in java?

Yes, 100% abstraction is possible in Java, but only by using interfaces.

Understanding Abstraction:
Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object or system.
100% Abstraction means that there are no concrete (implemented) methods in the abstraction; all methods are abstract, meaning they have no implementation in the defining class or interface.
Achieving 100% Abstraction:
Using Interfaces:

An interface in Java can provide 100% abstraction because all the methods declared in an interface are abstract by default (before Java 8). An interface cannot have method implementations (with exceptions introduced in Java 8 and later, which will be discussed below).
Example:
java
Copy code
interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // Abstract method
    void sleep();     // Abstract method
}
In the above interface, Animal, all methods are abstract, and there is no implementation. Any class that implements the Animal interface must provide implementations for these methods.
Abstract Classes:

An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, so it doesnâ€™t necessarily provide 100% abstraction.
However, if you design an abstract class with only abstract methods, it would theoretically provide 100% abstraction, but this is not typically the use case for abstract classes.
Interfaces and 100% Abstraction:
Before Java 8:

All methods in an interface were abstract by default. An interface could not contain any method implementations, so it provided 100% abstraction.
From Java 8 Onwards:

Java 8 introduced default methods and static methods in interfaces, which allowed interfaces to have method implementations.
Despite this, you can still achieve 100% abstraction by not using these features and only declaring abstract methods in your interface.
Example with Java 8 and later:
java
Copy code
interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // Abstract method
    void sleep();     // Abstract method
    // No default or static methods
}
Achieving 100% Abstraction in Practice:
When a class implements an interface, it must provide concrete implementations for all abstract methods declared in the interface.
Example:
java
Copy code
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
    void sleep();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Bark
        myDog.sleep();     // Outputs: Sleeping...
    }
}
In this example, the Animal interface provides 100% abstraction because it contains no implemented methods. The Dog class provides the implementations for these methods.

Summary:
100% abstraction is possible in Java using interfaces.
Interfaces allow you to define a contract with no implementation details, requiring any implementing class to provide the method implementations.
Abstract classes, while capable of providing abstraction, do not necessarily achieve 100% abstraction because they can contain implemented methods.
