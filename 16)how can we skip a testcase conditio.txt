how can we skip a testcase conditionally?
-----------------------------------------
Ans: In TestNG, you can skip a test case conditionally by using the SkipException class or by managing conditions directly in your test method. 
1. Using SkipException
You can throw a SkipException with a custom message if a certain condition is met, and TestNG will mark the test case as "Skipped."

eg:
==
import org.testng.SkipException;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class ConditionalSkipTest {

    @Test
    public void testFeature() {
        boolean featureEnabled = false;  // Condition to check if the feature is enabled
        
        if (!featureEnabled) {
            // If the feature is disabled, skip the test case
            throw new SkipException("Skipping this test as the feature is disabled.");
        }
        
        // Rest of the test code if the feature is enabled
        System.out.println("Executing test as the feature is enabled.");
    }
}

In this example, if featureEnabled is false, the test will throw a SkipException and be marked as "Skipped" in the TestNG report.
