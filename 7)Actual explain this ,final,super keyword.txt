7)explain this ,final,super keywords in java?

1. this Keyword:
================
The this keyword is a reference to the current objectâ€”the object whose method or constructor is being called. It is primarily used in the following scenarios:

Common Uses:
Referencing Instance Variables:
When a method or constructor has a parameter with the same name as an instance variable, this is used to differentiate between the instance variable and the parameter.
Example:
public class Example {
    int num;

    public Example(int num) {
        this.num = num; // 'this.num' refers to the instance variable, 'num' refers to the parameter
    }
}

Calling Another Constructor:
this() can be used to call another constructor in the same class. This is known as constructor chaining.
Example:
public class Example {
    int num;
    
    public Example() {
        this(10); // Calls the constructor that takes an int parameter
    }
    
    public Example(int num) {
        this.num = num;
    }
}

Passing the Current Object as an Argument:
this can be used to pass the current object as an argument to another method or constructor.
Example:
public class Example {
    public void display(Example obj) {
        System.out.println("Method called");
    }

    public void callMethod() {
        display(this); // Passes the current object
    }
}

this: Refers to the current object. Used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters, call other constructors, and pass the current object as an argument.
final: Used to create constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance. Applicable to variables, methods, and classes.
super: Refers to the parent class. Used to call parent class constructors, access parent class methods, and access parent class variables.
